# Cortex API

API for Cortex Admin Portal and Grey Matters App

## Setup

Install packages by running `npm install`.

Install MongoDB. You can install on Mac using either Homebrew or manually. With Homebrew, run `brew update` and `brew install mongodb`.

Start up MongoDB by running `mongod`. You should see `waiting for connections on port 27017`.

Now you just need to connect to the service. Connect to it by running `mongo`. Here you can issue MongoDB commands.

In MongoDB, create the database for Cortex by running `use cortex-dev`.
